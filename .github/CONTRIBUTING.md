# Contributing in @webpack-contrib

We'd always love contributions to further improve the webpack / webpack-contrib ecosystem!
Here are the guidelines we'd like you to follow:

- [Questions and Problems](#question)
- [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
- [Feature Requests](#feature)
- [Pull Request Submission Guidelines](#submit-pr)
- [Commit Message Conventions](#commit)

## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

Please submit support requests and questions to StackOverflow using the tag [[webpack]](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack).
StackOverflow is better suited for this kind of support though you may also inquire in [Webpack Gitter](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack).
The issue tracker is for bug reports and feature discussions.

## <a name="issue"></a> Found an Issue or Bug?

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, an issue for your problem may already exist, and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug, we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs, we ask that you provide a minimal reproduction scenario (GitHub repo or failing test case). Having a live, reproducible scenario gives us a wealth of important information without going back & forth to you with additional questions like:

- version of Webpack used
- version of the loader / plugin you are creating a bug report for
- the use-case that fails

A minimal reproduce scenario allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out config problems) as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem.

We will be insisting on a minimal reproduction scenario in order to save the maintainers' time and ultimately be able to fix more bugs. We understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essential bits of code from a larger codebase, but we really need to isolate the problem before we can fix it.

Unfortunately, we are unable to investigate or fix bugs without a minimal reproduction, so if we don't hear back from you, we may have to close an issue that doesn't have enough info to be reproduced.

## <a name="feature"></a> Feature Requests?

You can _request_ a new feature by creating an issue on GitHub.

If you would like to _implement_ a new feature yourself, please **first submit an issue** with a proposal to ensure the idea aligns with the goals of the project.

## <a name="submit-pr"></a> Pull Request Submission Guidelines

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

- Search GitHub for an open or closed PR related to your submission to avoid duplicating effort.
- Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our [commit message conventions](#commit). This is important because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.
- Complete the `Pull Request Template`. Pull requests that ignore the template will not be reviewed.
- Please sign the `Contributor License Agreement (CLA)` when you open your pull request. We cannot accept your contribution without it. Be sure to sign using the primary email address associated with your local and GitHub account.

## <a name="commit"></a> Webpack Contrib Commit Conventions

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**. The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

No line in the commit message should exceed 100 characters! This makes the message easier to read on GitHub as well as in various Git tools.

The footer should contain a [closing reference to an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) if any.

Examples:

```
docs(readme): update install instructions
```

```
fix: refer to the `entrypoint` instead of the first `module`
```

### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:`, followed by the header of the reverted commit.
In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type

Must be one of the following commit types:

- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: babel, npm)
- **chore**: Changes that fall outside of build / docs that do not effect source code (example scopes: package, defaults)
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: circleci, travis)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes (example scopes: readme, changelog)
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **revert**: Used when reverting a committed change
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons)
- **test**: Addition of or updates to Jest tests

### Scope

The scope is subjective & depends on the `type` see above. A good example of a scope would be a change to a particular class or module.

### Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" or "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" or "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast it with previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer should include any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** must start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` followed by a space or two new lines. The rest of the breaking change details should be provided after this.

Example

```
BREAKING CHANGE: Updates to `Chunk.mapModules`.

This release is not backwards compatible with `Webpack 2.x` due to breaking changes in webpack/webpack#4764
Migration: see webpack/webpack#5225

```

## Testing Your Pull Request

You may need to test your changes in a real-world project or a dependent module. Thankfully, GitHub provides a means to do this. To add a dependency to the `package.json` of such a project, use the following syntax:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "val-loader": "webpack-contrib/val-loader#{id}/head"
  }
}
```

Where `{id}` is the # ID of your Pull Request.

## Contributor License Agreement

When submitting your contribution, a CLA (Contributor License Agreement) bot will verify whether you have signed the [CLA](https://easycla.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/#/?version=2).
If it is your first time, it will link you to the right place to sign it.
However, if the email used in your commits doesn’t match the email associated with your GitHub account, the CLA bot won’t accept your contribution.

Run `git config user.email` to see your Git email, and verify it with [your GitHub email](https://github.com/settings/emails).

## Thanks

For your interest, time, understanding, and for following this simple guide.
